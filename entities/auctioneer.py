Couple remarks:
- I haven't worked with GitHub before, so I hope I didn't mess things up;
- Nor with code from multiple files (what I did before was just using one file with the 
  entire code). Therefore, I did nothing with the other files yet;
- I know the basics of Classes, and practiced with them, but I have no experience in 
  using Classes in my own projects.
- Don't really know yet how I can best test my code if it requires information from other
  sources (that are not ready yet). So I just made a seperate file using test data. That
  worked fine, but I figure that's not the optimal way, right?
If I'm using things the wrong way, please let me know.

Based on the Sandholm (2002) article, Middle Price 50:50 is best suited for determining
the prices in double auctions. This also happens to be a simple way of determining the
aution winners.

To keep it simple (for now), I followed these steps:
(1) Calculate Qs
(2) Calculate median Ps
(3) Calculate Qb
(2) Deleted the lowest bids from the buyers, so Qs = Qb
(3) Calculate median Pb
(4) Calculate auction price (average of Ps and Pb)
(5) Distribute the items to the highest bidders

I tested the function with this data:
    Bid = namedtuple('Bid', ['action', 'quantity', 'item_price'])
    
    buyers = [Bid("buy", 200, 0.45),
              Bid("buy", 250, 0.60),
              Bid("buy", 400, 0.57),
              Bid("buy", 150, 0.64)]
    
    sellers = [Bid("sell", 100, 0.80),
               Bid("sell", 80, 0.90),
               Bid("sell", 120, 0.79),
               Bid("sell", 100, 0.88),
               Bid("sell", 90, 0.84),
               Bid("sell", 50, 0.99),
               Bid("sell", 60, 0.92)]
    
    Results:
        There are 600 items for sale.
        Total demand is 1000
        Median seller price: 0.84
        Median buyer price: 0.6
        Final auction price: 0.72
        Buyer 0 gets 150 units.
        Buyer 1 gets 250 units.
        Buyer 2 gets 200 units.
        Buyer 3 gets nothing.
